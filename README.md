# CoroutineDownloader

Download Manager written purely in Kotlin. The app uses coroutines and channels to manage the downloading in background and Okio to buffer.

> ðŸš§ Contains the basic logic to download the file. The app does not use the `DownloadManager` class hence the notifications are broken. Feel free to pick it up ðŸ˜›
